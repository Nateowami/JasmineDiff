# JasmineDiff

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a great JavaScript testing framework, but sometimes it's hard to see the subtle differences between the expected value and the actual value. This is a tiny Chrome/Chromium extension that stays out of the way 99.99% of the time, and displays diffs under failing tests in Jasmine. Absolutely no configuration whatsoever.
